description: High-conviction experiments in Web3 for onboarding, infrastructure, and access.
---

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

What began as PORTERS.XYZ, a decentralised RPC infrastructure project, has evolved into **Data Gateways LLC** — a venture studio dedicated to building and backing rapid, high-conviction experiments in Web3. We focus on fast iteration, product traction, and applied research to compress the cycle between prototype and product-market fit.

We’ve learned that infrastructure wins are born from real-world friction: poor onboarding, inaccessible tools, and empty decentralisation promises. Our portfolio tackles these gaps directly — from onboarding flows like [**OnboardAI**](https://obi-livid.vercel.app/) to modular ecosystem tooling like **POPCO**.

> *We operate at the edge of usability, applying systems thinking and field-based insights to unlock new pathways into decentralised ecosystems.*


## How We Work

We are a venture builder focused on:

- **User-first onboarding**: meeting users where they are, with context-aware, AI-supported flows.
- **Infrastructure R&D**: building primitives that reduce developer and user burden.
- **Ecosystem alignment**: working closely with protocol teams to localise growth and solve onboarding bottlenecks.
- **Fast-cycle prototyping**: validating hypotheses through staged, low-burn MVPs that scale.

We back our ideas with design sprints, small grants, and collaborative experiments. Every prototype is an insight engine — giving back data, user signals, and system gaps.


## What We're Building

- **[OnboardAI](/projects/onboardai)**: A multilingual Telegram/WhatsApp AI guide that demystifies Web3 for emerging markets. From scams to wallets to Quai Network, it's the fastest way to go from zero to confidence in crypto.
- **[POPCO](/projects/popco)**: A plug-and-play governance toolkit for projects, allowing you to issue calls for proposals, track milestones, and unlock public goods funding pipelines with minimal overhead.
- **Experimental MVPs**: We ideate and challenge new concepts monthly — often low-burn, high-signal experiments exploring new governance, infra, or UX primitives.


## Our Team

We are a RaidGuild-born, Web3-native venture builder. Distributed by design and united by critical thinking, autonomy, and care for real-world impact.

## Get Involved

We’re seeking aligned funders, design partners, and ecosystems ready to run lean experiments with global impact.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that technology is not neutral but **social**. For our ventures, infrastructure accessibility, and human-centred design are not trade-offs but they are foundations. We build what we wish existed, we build fast with, and with people in mind.
